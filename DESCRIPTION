Description: The package SAM targets at high dimensional predictive
        modeling (regression and classification) for complex data
        analysis. SAM is short for sparse additive modeling, and adopts
        the computationally efficient basis spline technique. We solve
        the optimization problems by various computational algorithms
        including the block coordinate descent algorithm, fast
        iterative soft-thresholding algorithm, and newton method. The
        computation is further accelerated by warm-start and active-set
        tricks.
